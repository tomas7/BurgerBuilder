# Burger builder - React learning project
 
 Project is very heavily inspired by a tutorial from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller, as I followed (not copied) his tutorial when making this project a long time ago (in 2018)

# About this project

In this project, you can build a burger out of four ingredients. Make an order and send it to the database (Firebase DB). 

Project is my continues learning of react features and serves for testing new features and bugs.

## Some features:

### Create your burger out of four ingredients

### Order it (send the data to Firebase DB)

### See the total price as you adjust a number of ingredients

### Fill in contact form before submitting the data.

 work is still in progress and there are some extra re-renders I will take care in the near future.
